      <description>The Summer Story of 2023 It&amp;rsquo;s been one year since the last summer post. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even realize. It&amp;rsquo;s given me great perspective to see how far I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten in a year. It most certaintly calms my nerves, my worries, and my thoughts. I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten to go to plenty more in-person hackathons since. I&amp;rsquo;ve made Edison Hack Club a reality, and I&amp;rsquo;ve taken on a new sizeable project, TeenHacksLI as a director of the programming committee.</description>

      <description>The Summer Story of Kyle Liao in 2022 as of August 20th, 2022. As I write this I am currently ill with some sort of viral illness. Probably a cold or the flu, since two days of at home covid tests kits say I most certainly do not have covid.
Some might remark my summer as eventful. I got a 5 on the AP world exam, a 1490 on the SAT, I got my first job, I&amp;rsquo;m starting a fiscally sponsored organization; all of those things are crazy and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have seen myself doing them 6 months ago.</description>

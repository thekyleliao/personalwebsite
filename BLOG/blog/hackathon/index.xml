      <description>The Summer Story of 2023 It&amp;rsquo;s been one year since the last summer post. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even realize. It&amp;rsquo;s given me great perspective to see how far I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten in a year. It most certaintly calms my nerves, my worries, and my thoughts. I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten to go to plenty more in-person hackathons since. I&amp;rsquo;ve made Edison Hack Club a reality, and I&amp;rsquo;ve taken on a new sizeable project, TeenHacksLI as a director of the programming committee.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this 10 days after winning a hackathon. It&amp;rsquo;s surreal. As Sahib said, it was like a 48 hour fever dream. It all started from just one day. The right place the right time kind of situation. I was checking hackathons.hackclub.com to find hackathons. Nothing new. I went to check MLH.io hackathons and found it. HackPHS, in Princeton NJ for High School students. I clicked on the website to make sure it was a date and time I could attend.</description>

      <description>Project Diani was a 24 hour hackathon project based off of Arduino, which was written in C++ where my main job was creating the documentation and the website for it. The team was composed off our lead C++ dev, Sahib, along with Batuhuan as C++ assist, and Dorian our overall designer, and me as our front end.
9:00 AM We arrive at 9 AM and enter. The opening talk starts at 10.</description>

      <description>The Summer Story of 2023 It&amp;rsquo;s been one year since the last summer post. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even realize. It&amp;rsquo;s given me great perspective to see how far I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten in a year. It most certaintly calms my nerves, my worries, and my thoughts. I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten to go to plenty more in-person hackathons since. I&amp;rsquo;ve made Edison Hack Club a reality, and I&amp;rsquo;ve taken on a new sizeable project, TeenHacksLI as a director of the programming committee.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this 10 days after winning a hackathon. It&amp;rsquo;s surreal. As Sahib said, it was like a 48 hour fever dream. It all started from just one day. The right place the right time kind of situation. I was checking hackathons.hackclub.com to find hackathons. Nothing new. I went to check MLH.io hackathons and found it. HackPHS, in Princeton NJ for High School students. I clicked on the website to make sure it was a date and time I could attend.</description>

      <description>The Summer Story of Kyle Liao in 2022 as of August 20th, 2022. As I write this I am currently ill with some sort of viral illness. Probably a cold or the flu, since two days of at home covid tests kits say I most certainly do not have covid.
Some might remark my summer as eventful. I got a 5 on the AP world exam, a 1490 on the SAT, I got my first job, I&amp;rsquo;m starting a fiscally sponsored organization; all of those things are crazy and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have seen myself doing them 6 months ago.</description>

      <description>Project Diani was a 24 hour hackathon project based off of Arduino, which was written in C++ where my main job was creating the documentation and the website for it. The team was composed off our lead C++ dev, Sahib, along with Batuhuan as C++ assist, and Dorian our overall designer, and me as our front end.
9:00 AM We arrive at 9 AM and enter. The opening talk starts at 10.</description>

      <description>Long Time Coming I&amp;rsquo;m proud of the fact that I have enough work to put on a website now. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to have a website, especially one that runs. There are still things to be worked out. For one, I am writing this in notepad. However, the website works right. Markdown doesn&amp;rsquo;t care where you write it.
This site will be a catalogue of projects: hackathon, side, school, etc. Anything that I think is worth putting here will go here.</description>

      <description>#Welcome
Hopefully this works. Next challenge is getting it onto gitlab. Soemtimes you need to just sit down and watch the youtube guide. Times like this is when I wish future me could help me out. Simplicity is in hindsight. Future site is knowing there are gonna be screw ups. I accidently deleted the folder with hugo on it. Had to restore it lol. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope gitlab goes well. haven&amp;rsquo;t used it before.</description>

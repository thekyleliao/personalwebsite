      <description>Project Diani was a 24 hour hackathon project based off of Arduino, which was written in C++ where my main job was creating the documentation and the website for it. The team was composed off our lead C++ dev, Sahib, along with Batuhuan as C++ assist, and Dorian our overall designer, and me as our front end.
9:00 AM We arrive at 9 AM and enter. The opening talk starts at 10.</description>

      <description>Long Time Coming I&amp;rsquo;m proud of the fact that I have enough work to put on a website now. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to have a website, especially one that runs. There are still things to be worked out. For one, I am writing this in notepad. However, the website works right. Markdown doesn&amp;rsquo;t care where you write it.
This site will be a catalogue of projects: hackathon, side, school, etc. Anything that I think is worth putting here will go here.</description>

      <description>#Welcome
Hopefully this works. Next challenge is getting it onto gitlab. Soemtimes you need to just sit down and watch the youtube guide. Times like this is when I wish future me could help me out. Simplicity is in hindsight. Future site is knowing there are gonna be screw ups. I accidently deleted the folder with hugo on it. Had to restore it lol. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope gitlab goes well. haven&amp;rsquo;t used it before.</description>
